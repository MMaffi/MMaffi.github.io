## About Me

I cultivate an unwavering passion for the fusion of music and technology. I started my programming journey at the age of 16, diving into a variety of online courses that provided me with a solid foundation in this vast field of knowledge. <br>
Music has been a constant in my life since the age of six when I immersed myself in the notes and rhythms that compose the universal language of sound art. This affinity led to two years dedicated to music teaching, where I had the privilege of sharing my knowledge with other enthusiasts. <br>
From the beginning, my intrinsic interest in the possibilities the digital world offers has been a driving force in my journey. Always eager to explore and uncover new technological frontiers, I am constantly improving and immersing myself in this field, striving to expand my expertise and contribute meaningfully to future advancements in this dynamic and promising area. <br>
